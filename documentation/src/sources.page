### frequency

Valid values for frequency include:

    each (second / minute / hour / day / week / month / quarter / year)
    hourly / daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly / annually / yearly
    one-time / other / unknown

A complete, up-to-date list can be found in [frequency.rb in the frequency gem](http://github.com/djsun/frequency/blob/master/lib/frequency.rb).

### missing

    false  existing data set, can we found on the Web
    true   
If false, the data set is an existing data set that can be found on the Web.
When a data set is marked as missing, the validations are less strict.

### broken_links

This key holds the number of broken links for the source and a timestamp. For example:

    { :count => 3, :updated_at => "2010-07-01" },
